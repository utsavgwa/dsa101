## Usage

Feel free to explore the code in this repository to learn about various data structures and algorithms. You can use these programs to understand the implementations and test them with your custom inputs. Each program is adequately documented to explain its purpose and functionality.

To run any of the programs, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. Simply compile the Java source files and execute the resulting class files to see the program in action.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a log of my learning progress, I welcome contributions and suggestions. If you find any bugs, optimizations, or have additional programs to add, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can make this repository a valuable resource for anyone learning data structures and algorithms in Java.
